 More Typography Changes: 
 1. Don't show "Default (Theme)" for Font and "Default" for Font Size. Show the actual font and size. Add an * next to the font name to indicate that it is the default font.
 2. Order the fonts alphabetically.
 3. When selecting a different theme, ask if fonts need to be changed to the default font for that theme or if the custom fonts should be kept.
